My name is Philip Sequeira and I am in love with technology.

I left a career in the Air Force as an intelligence professional after seven years and moved to Honolulu with my wife to pursue my passion for information technology applications and programming. To this end I am currently a Management Information Systems major at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and expect to graduate in Summer 2021.

While I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing technology in the Air Force, I found myself with a growing thirst for knowledge and experience working directly in the IT field. My ultimate goal is to become the best IT professional that I can, while leveraging my military experience and discipline to provide the backbone of my success.

When I am not studying or gaming with my friends, I work on personal programming projects on platforms such as the Raspberry Pi, build computers for friends, train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and work out at the gym. I find that stress is best managed through physical fitness, mental challenge, or just playing video games. I am the consummate computer nerd and I am proud of it.

During my time in the military, I learned how to work effectively alone, as part of a small team and as a member of a large organization. As a graduate of the Air Force's Airman Leadership School, I understand how vital effective followership and communication are to the success of any undertaking. I have worked on dozens of long and short-term projects ranging from implementing cutting-edge technologies and databases for large organizations, to developing training methodology and conducting that training for new users while maintaining related statistical data.

I look forward to continuing my studies in the IT field through ITM classes at the University of Hawaii and to continuously improve my skills.
