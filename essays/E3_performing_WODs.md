The most recent WOD was Invoice1. This was the most fun I've had with a WOD yet. One of my favorite things with programming in general is making new projects and seeing the results. I did this one several times to play around with different things such as making functions for inserting rows, since it was a repeated action. I learned a lot about the details of JavaScript but the most interesting thing for me is always seeing the similarities and differences between languages. String templates and the toFixed() function in JavaScript remind me somewhat of the printf() function in C. The flexability of JavaScript, however, makes playing with these features more fun than the chore it tends to be in those lower-level languages. In the future, if I had more time, I would have tried using classes for products to incorporate some OOP into the page and make the code a bit more reusable.
